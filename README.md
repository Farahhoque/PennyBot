# PennyBot

PennyBot is an innovative project aimed at enhancing financial literacy among Canadian students. Developed as part of a non-profit initiative, PennyBot leverages data analysis and interactive tools to educate users about financial management. This project is especially significant given the startling statistic that less than one in five Canadians believe they possess strong financial literacy skills.
